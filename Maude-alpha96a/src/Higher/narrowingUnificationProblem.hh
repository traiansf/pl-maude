//	Hacked up version of UnificationProblem to support narrowing. This should ultimately
//	refactored with UnificationProblem. The reason for having a separate class at the moment is:
//
//	(1) Narrowing unification problems start with a pair of dag nodes rather than a pair of vectors of terms.
//	(2) Narrowing unification gets its variable info from the rule being used
//	(3) Narrowing unification uses a non-standard allocation of slots within substitutions:
//	
//	(rule variables) (rule rhs temporaries) (unused) (narrowing term variables)
//	^                ^                               ^
//	0                #protected for rule             size of substitution for module
//
//	(4) Unifiers should be expressed in terms of "fresh" variables that reuse the variable name and
//	substitution slot space.
//	(5) Narrowing unification does not corrupt previously generated unifiers when making the next unifier, at
//	the cost of more copying if an unsorted unifier corresponds to multiple order-sorted unifiers.
//	(6) Narrowing unification supports the idea of "odd" and "even" variables to avoid clashing variable
//	names on successive steps of narrowing.
